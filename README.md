# linguistics-classification-models
Bayesian and frequentist classification models implemented with behavioral data

These files are for the workshop on binary logistic regression  and classification 
for linguistic data at the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle

These files are working versions of Kimball, Yiu & Watson 2019 and  Kimball & Cole (submitted) 

These versions are "working" in that they are subject to revision and improvments,
(i.e.  NOT the version of record that goes with the manuscript )

Each sub-folder contains a heavily commented .R file and final anonymized data that will enable the 
user to re-run all of the analyses
